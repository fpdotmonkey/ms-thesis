  abstract        = {Aeroengine is a complex control system with strong nonlinearity. An aeroengine safe reinforcement learning control based on barrier function are proposed to improve the safety of aeroengine. Aiming at the safety limit and optimal control of aeroengine exhaust temperature (EGT), this paper takes the JT9D aeroengine on the T-MATS simulation platform as the experimental object. We can obtain the optimal control under the condition of satisfying the temperature safety limit by setting the barrier function and combining the different strategy iteration and reinforcement learning theory. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional controller, the safe reinforcement learning control method can effectively limit the exhaust temperature of the aeroengine within a safe range and optimize its control effect.},

Furthermore, we present control of constrained 2-DOF manipulators as an example to show how to implement our proposed solution to EL systems.

We propose a learning-supported model predictive force and motion control scheme that provides stochastic safety guarantees while adapting to changing situations. Gaussian processes (GPs) are used to learn the uncertain relations that map the robot’s states to the forces and moments. The model predictive controller uses these Gaussian process models to achieve precise motion and force control under stochastic constraint satisfaction. As the uncertainty only occurs in the static model parts — the output equations — a computationally efficient stochastic MPC formulation is used. analysis of recursive feasibility of the optimal control problem and convergence of the closed loop system for the static uncertainty case are given. Chance constraint formulation and back-offs are constructed based on the variance of the Gaussian process to guarantee safe operation. The approach is illustrated on a lightweight robot in simulations and experiments.},

The superiority of the direct MV approach is shown by developing and comparing direct versus indirect learning approaches and MV versus certainty-equivalence (CE) approaches. First, it is shown that probabilistic safety can be guaranteed by ensuring probabilistic  $\lambda $ -contractivity of the safe set. Four data-based convex optimization-based algorithms are introduced to ensure the probabilistic  $\lambda $ -contractivity of the safe set (i.e., direct and indirect CE, direct and indirect MV). It is shown that while the CE approach results in a risk-neutral control design method with no robustness guarantees, the MV approach results in a risk-averse control design with probabilistic safety guarantees. This is because MV approach aims at learning a control gain that minimizes the variance of the state of the closed-loop system with respect to the safe set, and thus minimizes the risk of safety violation. Besides, it is shown that the direct learning approach requires weaker data richness conditions (i.e., lower sample complexity) than the indirect learning approach. Two simulation examples are provided to verify that the direct MV learning approach outperforms the other three approaches since it leads to low-complexity (i.e., low sample complexity and convex optimization) safe learning with a high probability of safety guarantees.},

The control action composition is achieved by taking a weighted mixture of the existing controllers according to the contribution of each component task. Instead of sophisticatedly tuning the cost parameters and other hyperparameters for safe and reliable behavior in the optimal control framework, the safety of each single-task solution is guaranteed using the control barrier functions (CBFs) for high relative degree stochastic systems, which constrains the system state within a known safe operation region where it originates from. Linearity of CBF constraints in control ensures the feasibility of safe control action composition. The discussed framework can immediately provide reliable solutions to new tasks by taking a weighted mixture of solved component-task actions and satisfying some CBF constraints, instead of performing an extensive sampling to compute a new controller. Our results are verified and demonstrated on both a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and two cooperative UAV teams in an environment with obstacles.},

The vehicle is controlled autonomously by a model predictive controller (MPC) tracking a given trajectory, while at the same time human input is provided via a joystick. Unlike traditional mixed-initiative control methods that blend weighted human and vehicle inputs, the proposed arbitrator first adopts control barrier function (CBF) to generate weights for human and vehicle inputs under safety critical situations, and then employs the null-space based control (NSBC) to merge the two inputs with priorities determined by the weights. As a result, the final input to the vehicle has a clear physical meaning that represents dynamic priorities of human and vehicle autonomous inputs, in which the higher priority input is fully adopted and the lower priority input is partially adopted without intervening the higher priority input. An immediate advantage of the proposed arbitrator is that there is no need to tune the weights between human and autonomous inputs. Simulation results show that the dynamic safe arbitrator is effective for shared control.},

By performing a loop transformation and convexifying the safety-stabilization conditions, the safe learning controller design is further transformed into a constrained optimization problem, which is independent of the attitude states and thus can be solved offline. Finally, the trained higher-dimensional safe learning controller is mapped to the 3-D attitude controller of the original nonlinear system via the least-squares method for online implementation.

Derived from existing solutions, a modular control system had been developed to simplify the programming procedure. It subordinates all robots under an independent central control module, which leads to equality, exchangeability and reconfigurability of the robots. The control system was implemented in a layout of simple kinematic units which can be easily reconfigured within an assembly platform. Therefore the modularity of the control system must follow the modularity of the complete mechatronic system. The control concept is independent from the robot manufacturer and will be validated for different industrial robots in future research.

A fuzzy logic system (FLS) is designed to estimate cost function and unknown system dynamics of MRRs respectively. Through the use of ADP method, construct a local online VI algorithm and solving HJB equation with approximate cost function, then the decentralized FLS-based optimal control method is realized. On the basis of Lyapunov theorem the MRR system is proved to be asymptotically stable. At last, simulation results show the availability of the suggested method.},

  abstract        = {In this paper a modular distributed control architecture for robotic exoskeletons is presented. On a research environment, an exoskeleton can be used for experimental studies on several fields, such as motor control, assistive technologies or ergonomics. However, robotic exoskeletons are usually very expensive and time demanding to build, leading to a limited number of existing prototypes. A modular open system may enable the use of a single exoskeleton device for different several simultaneous researches leading to a better resource utilization. A first step in the development of an open modular exoskeleton is the design of a distributed and modular control architecture for these devices. The presented architecture was divided into tree modules: central processor, nodes and network system. Although this approach is not completely novel, it is innovative on the fact that these three modules follow a standardization in order to enable direct replacement without modification on the other modules. The network system is the only application independent and a custom network was designed in order to be simple to implement without requiring advanced technical knowledge and without a loss of performance. In addition to the advantage of being flexible and easy to modify, the presented architecture enables the implementation of bio-inspired hierarchical control routines, thus being suitable to validate theories and mathematical models.},

Creating and upgrading a repository of reusable components suitable for many systems that share common characteristics present a challenge for engineers, especially if composition mechanisms must be founded on control theories of discrete event systems and if formal synthesis tools must be integrated into well-accepted component-based software development processes. This paper explores a component model and a pragmatic method for the development of control software systems. The method, along with the underlying component model, fills the gap between a hierarchical control theory and component-based software engineering. A detailed case study developed around a Festo didactic learning modular production system demonstrates the relevance of the proposed approach to industrial application.},

  abstract   = {This paper develops a control methodology that unifies control barrier functions and control Lyapunov functions through quadratic programs. The result is demonstrated on adaptive cruise control, which presents both safety and performance considerations, as well as actuator bounds. We begin by presenting a novel notion of a barrier function associated with a set, formulated in the context of Lyapunov-like conditions; the existence of a barrier function satisfying these conditions implies forward invariance of the set. This formulation naturally yields a notion of control barrier function (CBF), yielding inequality constraints in the control input that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through these constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for the simultaneous achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs). These formulations are illustrated in the context of adaptive cruise control, where the control objective of achieving a desired speed is balanced by the minimum following conditions on a lead car and force-based constraints on acceleration and braking.},

  abstract  = {This workshop discusses, presents, and demos examples of how advances in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) and in Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) will benefit Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). CAV technologies provide an enormous opportunity to generate and collect traffic datasets that directly impact Highway Traffic Management Operations (HTOps). CAV provides novel datasets in terms of types and pervasiveness of coverage of highway networks at a scale that we have not been exposed to before. This enables current HTOps for extensions in features and enhancements in accuracies. HTOps, as defined by Canadian ITS architecture [1], aims at managing traffic to enhance the efficiency of highways, avoid congestion, increase the safety of travelers, and enable more sustainable transportation. This workshop focuses on answering the following question “What (and How) are the features of CAV-generated data that can leverage (HTOps)?” We compare CAV-generated data to traditional traffic data (those collected from relatively “fixed location” sources such as CCTV, electronic loop detectors) and those collected from probe floating vehicles.Extensive research has been conducted into creating self-driving cars that can drive and maneuver on roads in a safe manner. This is embodied in the development of advanced safety features that include blind spot information, reversing/ parking/ lane change assistance, collision warning, and more. CAV can make movement actions based on knowledge of surroundings which relies on hundreds of thousands of data points collected from embedded sensors (LiDAR, cameras, radars, OBD unit, an IMU), (estimated at) a few Terabytes/Vehicle/Day. For example, Volvo’s Cirrus [2] and Lyft Level 5 [3] open-sourced datasets make use of high-resolution video cameras as well as LiDAR sensors to produce Gaussian points that monitor vehicle 3600 surroundings.As an example HTOPS service, we discuss in detail Variable Speed Limits (VSL) and how CAV data can be used to optimize maximum travel speed limit in a dynamic manner over different highway zones based on traffic, congestion, and weather. VSL helps achieve the objectives of HTOps, including devising premeditated plans for peak hours operations and controlling the travel speed in order to increase the throughput of vehicles. To increase safety and ensure compliance, gradual implementation through increments/ decrements of speed along highway zones is required. The extent, expressiveness and quality of CAV data can help achieve such advanced HTOps. For example, the nuScenes dataset [4] that uses linked data to break down and simplify data schema (with various objects such as Category, Ego Pose, Instance, Lidarseg, Map, Sample_annotation, and Sample Data.) With the help of distance measurements, space headings can be accurately defined for vehicles in front and behind the main car. In addition, current vehicle speed data can be obtained from onboard in real-time. This can also be extended to other HTOps services such as Dynamic Lane Management (DLM) which sets lane allocation rules based on the given traffic state, assigning a lane(s) to a prioritized class of vehicle or assigning variable travel speeds for each lane.CAV manufacturers and researchers have made significant progress in building a CAV technology stack that allows a vehicle to drive itself in a safe manner. The technology stack consists of sensing (described above), perception, prediction, and planning layers. The higher three layers use sophisticated deep learning machine learning to process collected data and produce further information on highway traffic conditions. For example, with camera footage, object (e.g. pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs) detection software can be applied to identify, categorize and characterize surrounding objects. At the same time, LiDAR data can be mapped to provide a bird’s eye spatial view of the surrounding area. Such semantic object maps with binding boxes on objects and trajectory lines are valuable data that TMCs can use to understand the current roadway environment. This is important for understanding stopping time, and congestion levels between cars on the highway provided the current lane of the vehicle. However, due to how recent such developments are, the focus has been on developing the sensing and perception layers of that stack, with much less focus given to the prediction and planning layers.},

  abstract = {The industrial world is moving towards digitization since the mid twentieth century and the latest industrial evolution is called Industry 4.0. The advancing technologies like big data, industrial internet of things (IoT), cloud and cognitive computing, predictive analytics are the key enablers of Industry 4.0. One of such advancing technologies is digital twin which is considered to be the backbone of today’s industry. The conventional method of heavy duty machinery development is time consuming, costly and require a highly skilled and trained professional. Leveraging the digital twin solution in such cases helps in all the phases of a product lifecycle from the design phase to the maintenance phase and increase the productivity and efficiency of the product. Digital twin approach also advances the industry towards sustainable manufacturing by reducing the carbon footprint which is specially required for heavy duty machinery like Dolores, the test rig used for the research. The work done for the thesis covers the initial part of the process involved in developing the digital twin. This thesis develops a multibody dynamic based mechanical model of a heavy duty machinery present in the Mechanical laboratory of Aalto University. The behavior of the developed model is then compared to the real-time system. A digital twin must have a interface between the real-time system and the virtual system. The link between the physical real-time system and the virtual system is created via Simulink. In this thesis work, only the external interface between the virtual system and Simulink is developed, the external interface between the physical real-time system and Simulink is out of the scope. The results indicate that the developed model behaves as desired and closely follows the behavior of the physical real-time system. The external socket interface developed shows that the connection is robust and the data flow between the two software is accurate with no latency.},

In recent years, the development of robots that entertain people by playing a variety of musical instruments has been observed. Many of these robots have specific features, for example, artificial lips for playing wind instruments. However, particularly when performing special musical effects, such as vibrato, tremolo, and tonguing, robots playing wind instruments often produce artificial sounds that differ considerably from those produced by their human counterparts. To build an alto-recorder-playing robot that produces natural sounds matching those produced by a human player, this study employs unsteady flow rate measurements and control techniques. A spool type servo valve and a quick response laminar flow sensor (QFS), whose dynamic characteristics are calibrated by an unsteady flow rate generator, are applied to control the blown air for the robot.},

  abstract      = {Industrial cyber-physical systems require complex distributed software to orchestrate many heterogeneous mechatronic components and control multiple physical processes. Industrial automation software is typically developed in a model-driven fashion where abstractions of physical processes called plant models are co-developed and iteratively refined along with the control code. Testing such multi-dimensional systems is extremely difficult because often models might not be accurate, do not correspond accurately with subsequent refinements, and the software must eventually be tested on the real plant, especially in safety-critical systems like nuclear plants. This paper proposes a framework wherein high-level functional requirements are used to automatically generate test cases for designs at all abstraction levels in the model-driven engineering process. Requirements are initially specified in natural language and then analyzed and specified using a formalized ontology. The requirements ontology is then refined along with controller and plant models during design and development stages such that test cases can be generated automatically at any stage. A representative industrial water process system case study illustrates the strengths of the proposed formalism. The requirements meta-model proposed by the CESAR European project is used for requirements engineering while IEC 61131-3 and model-driven concepts are used in the design and development phases. A tool resulting from the proposed framework called REBATE (Requirements Based Automatic Testing Engine) is used to generate and execute test cases for increasingly concrete controller and plant models.},

  abstract = {In off-road mobile machinery, hydraulics are commonly used due to their high power-to-weight ratio, robustness, and affordability. Major disadvantage of traditional hydraulic systems is their generally poor energy efficiency, which increases emissions and increases operational costs. Also, in electric mobile machinery, operational times are negatively affected due to limited battery power. Such issues are major motivators for development of more energy efficient solutions in recent years.
Typical research methods for novel hydraulic systems includes test bench and simulation of studied system. Experimental test bench is typically loaded with either mass or load cylinder, capable of generating static loads. However, due to work cycles in field usage, hydraulic systems are almost never statically loaded. Therefore, data generated by statically loaded test bench is not directly comparable to field usage. Ideally, test benches would include load system capable of inducing loads similar to field usage, which could produce energy efficiency results relevant to actual field operation.
In this research dynamic load system was designed and implemented to direct driven hydraulic (DDH) test bench simulating mine loaders articulated steering system. Load system was tested with dynamic load reference simulating field usage and several static load situations to test system performance with high pressure and speed. System was first simulated before implementation and experimental testing were performed.
Target values for static and dynamic load situations were defined. In dynamic loading, target was for measured pressure, integrated respect to time, to stay within 5 percentage points of integrated reference pressure. In static loading, pass ranges were defined as within 5 percentage points of target value for each test. Load system could perform dynamic loading in DDH circuit following reference profile with 93.4% accuracy, which fell 1.6 percentage points short of target value of 95%. Static loading tests stayed within defined target values until after 100 mm/s actuation speed and 200 bar pressure thresholds were surpassed in steering system. In simulation environment all test stayed within target values. Overall, load system showed clear functionality as intended in both cases, although not all target values were reached. Improvements to load system control and architecture were suggested.},

  abstract = {Because of the tightening emission regulations, reduction of the energy consumption is one of the main development goals of mobile work machinery. Electrification and hybridization are key methods in this process. In mobile work machinery often major amount of the engine’s mechanical power is first converted to hydraulic, which is transmitted and converted back to mechanical power of the actuators. For this reason, the energy efficiency of the hydraulic system has a significant impact on the energy consumption of the machinery.
Usually, the energy efficiencies of hydraulic systems are low compared to mechanical or electro-mechanical alternatives. This is mainly because of the throttling losses in directional control valves, where the energy is dissipated and converted into heat. In direct drive hydraulic system, the hydraulic actuator is directly controlled with the rotational speed and direction of electrically operated hydraulic pump. This eliminates the throttling losses in control valves enhancing the energy efficiency of the system.
In this research the energy efficiency of a direct drive hydraulic system was measured and simulated. The measurements were executed in a test bench which was used for load lifting and lowering. Three different loads and velocities were used to study how they affect the energy efficiency. Besides the experimental measurements, a simulation model of the system was created. The goal was to create a realistic model which can be used for energy efficiency analysis and future research work with the system.
The load and velocity had a remarkable effect on system’s energy efficiency. The best total efficiency of the system was 82 % in load lifting cycle of lowest velocity and highest load.  During the same cycle, 79 % of system’s mechanical power was available for regeneration.  The worst total efficiency of the system was 44 % with lowest load and highest velocity. This cycle also required positive input power from the servomotor during load lowering. The differences between simulated and measured results were 0…5 % in most cycles.
The measurement results revealed a remarkable energy saving potential of direct drive hydraulic system. The efficiency’s strong dependency on load and velocity shows the importance of component sizing according to the operational requirements. While the typical energy efficiencies of conventional hydraulic systems are around 35 %, the direct drive hydraulics would allow remarkable energy savings in mobile work machinery.},

The dynamic co- simulation of TAS is achieved firstly to confirm the system design and parameters. The dynamic modelling of the mechanism is implemented by ADAMS software. The hydraulic driving system and control system are derived mathematically and implemented via MATLAB. Then, the dynamic simulation of TAS is achieved through the co- simulation of ADAMS and MATLAB to verify the active compensation control performance of TAS. After that, a full-scale test rig is set up for experimental verification. The vertical height, roll angle and vertical acceleration of the TAS end effector can be reduced effectively through active motion compensation control, thus, improving the access safety of the offshore wind turbine.},

Furthermore, by means of a polyoptimization method, the optimum geometry of a steering mechanism has been established in view of design and operational requirements. Such a procedure is more advantageous than that of common designing practice nowadays which relies frequently either on using and adapting the well known solutions or analysing some random concepts. The polyoptimization method discused in this paper, in comparison with the most frequent design methods with one target function, provides a designer with more realistic results. The new solutions obtained through polyoptimization and synthesis have preferably design and operational parameters. The method discussed can also be successfully used in other areas of technology.},

  abstract  = {Environmental restrictions and economic opportunities create demand to investigate the potential of further hybridization of non-road mobile machinery (NRMM). Many proposals for energy saving in hydraulic systems have been researched. In addition to well-established methods, there are zonal or decentralized hydraulics – an approach first introduced in the aircraft industry. In a fully decentralized system, the hydraulic pumps are disconnected from the engine and replaced with hydraulic power packs distributed throughout the system. In this study, decentralized hydraulics are realized with a direct driven hydraulics drive (DDH). By applying DDH, further hybridization can be achieved which will lead to increased productivity, minimized energy consumption, and robust performance in mobile machines operating in various environments. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the energy efficiency of the excavator hydraulic system equipped with DDH under typical digging cycles. For this purpose, a model which coupled multi-body dynamics, hydraulic system, and an electric motor is developed in the Matlab Simulink environment. Simulation results are validated by a simplified representation of micro excavator (one example of DDH) as a proof of concept.},

The aim of the research work was to reveal the potential advantages and challenges of the new direct pump control concept as well as the suitability of hydraulic pumps for variable-speed operation.
Measurements of component efficiency have proven that hydraulic components have very good efficiency compared with variable-speed electric motors. Therefore, the total efficiency of the electric- hydrostatic drive at a high load (close to corner power) cannot be expected to be noticeably better than the conventional drive system comprising an asynchronous electric motor and variable-displace- ment hydraulic pump, although fixed-displacement pumps can have better efficiency than variable- displacement pumps have. Improvements may be seen at part-load. The major advantages of the new motor-pump concept are reduction in power losses and noise during part-load and during idling. This was demonstrated in a test cycle.
The design of hydraulic pumps applied in an electric-hydrostatic drive has to be carefully evaluated for suitability. Some piston pumps and internal gear pumps without gap compensation seem to work well under the specific load conditions of variable-speed drives, but not all units worked sufficiently during endurance testing. Owing to the high overload capability of rare earth electric motors, the dynamic performance of the electric-hydrostatic drive can be compared with that of many standard variable-displacement pumps. This was evaluated with performance tests or the clamp unit of a plastics injection moulding machine. The dry cycle time (Euromap 6 standard) achieved (1.8 s for a machine with a 1600 kN clamping force) proved the excellent controllability of the electric-hydrostatic drive and the high dynamic performance capability.
The combination of a speed-controlled a.c. servomotor and fixed-displacement pump increases the number of direct pump control concepts that a hydraulic project engineer can apply to design competi- tive hydraulic systems for customer applications.},

Taking advantage of that merits, some research about robots that are used pneumatic actuator have been conducted. In the context of that, we have developed hand manipulator which is driven by compact pneumatic cylinder. Although pneumatic actuators are more difficult to control precisely than electric motor used conventionally, for this problem, we are studying the application of control using E-FRIT (Extended Fictitious Reference Iterative Tuning), which is a PID gain adjustment method based on experimental data. In this paper, we show the result of applying controller design with E-FRIT to developed manipulator.},

However, the device did not have enough force and stiffness to drive shoulders with both arms. In this study, to get enough generated force and stiffness of the device, a parallel arranged EFPA reinforced with circumferential restraint was proposed and tested. The rehabilitation device for shoulder joint using the improved actuator was also proposed and tested. The built-in attitude control system using valves, sensors and an embedded controller was also developed. As a result, it can be confirmed that the device can give passive exercise with larger moving area and enough force and torque to move patient’s shoulder joint.},

To develop such a technology, an actuator safe and friendly for human is required. It should be small, lightweight and has to provide a proper softness. We call such an actuator soft actuator. A pneumatic rubber artificial muscle is one of typical soft actuators, which is useful for the human assist technology. We have developed some types of pneumatic rubber artificial muscles and applied them to human friendly soft mechanisms and wearable power assist devices. Since these mechanism and devices directly act on the human body, the human friendliness is essentially important. A wearable power assist device is equipped to the human body to assist the muscular force, which supports activities of daily living, rehabilitation, heavy working, training and so on.
In this paper, some types of rubber muscles developed and manufactured in our laboratory are introduced. A soft robot hand for wiping the human body and a parallel manipulator for the wrist rehabilitation are described as soft mechanisms. Further, a wearable power assist glove and a power assist splint for upper arm are shown. Some evaluations clarify the effectiveness of pneumatic soft actuator for an innovative human assist technology.},

In response to the attack, JPL installed additional monitoring agents on its firewalls and continues to work with NASA to review network access agreements for external partners.

The April 2018 cyberattack exploited this particular weakness when the hacker accessed the JPL network by targeting a Raspberry Pi computer that was not authorized to be attached to the JPL network.

During the April 2018 cyberattack, one of the four compromised systems had not been patched for the vulnerability in a timely manner, ultimately resulting in the exfiltration of 23 files containing approximately 500 megabytes of data.

Prior to detection and containment of the incident, the attacker exfiltrated approximately 500 megabytes of data from 23 files, 2 of which contained International Traffic in Arms Regulations information related to the Mars Science Laboratory mission.},

  abstract  = {Fluid power systems can be enormously complex. The chiefest complexity is in their control components due to the deep knowledge required for effective development, the need to interface with myriad heterogeneous components, and the opacity of its operation. In the IT sector, a tech stack is a known discretization of function within a system, typically used to categorize what software tools do. This enables disparate parts of a system to be developed separately. Inspired by IT tech stacks, this paper presents a model, the mechatronic tech stack, to mitigate this complexity by siloing control system behavior into discrete functions and classifying what tools can be used to meet them. The model is demonstrated on three case studies of diverse application. The theory is promising, but there are challenges in defining the most useful abstractions and interfaces.},

  abstract  = {The most obvious method for determining the distortion of telegraph signals is to calculate the transients of the telegraph system. This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal conditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for making this translation. A discussion is given of the minimum frequency range required for transmission at a given speed of signaling. In the case of carrier telegraphy, this discussion includes a comparison of single-sideband and double-sideband transmission. A number of incidental topics is also discussed.},

As a basis for performance predictions and optimizations, we would need faithful models of their behavior, which are, unfortunately, seldom available.
 In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a tool to construct faithful models of the latency, throughput, and port usage of x86 instructions. To this end, we first discuss common notions of instruction throughput and port usage, and introduce a more precise definition of latency that, in contrast to previous definitions, considers dependencies between different pairs of input and output operands. We then develop novel algorithms to infer the latency, throughput, and port usage based on automatically-generated microbenchmarks that are more accurate and precise than existing work.
 To facilitate the rapid construction of optimizing compilers and tools for performance prediction, the output of our tool is provided in a machine-readable format. We provide experimental results for processors of all generations of Intel’s Core architecture, i.e., from Nehalem to Coffee Lake, and discuss various cases where the output of our tool differs considerably from prior work.},

  abstract = {During the last 10 years, most of the technological advancements have occurred in the field of high volume products like mobile phones, DVD players, microwave ovens etc. New York Times stated that "On average an American comes in contact with sixty microprocessors in a day". All this is possible because of the progress made in the field of embedded systems.
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), being the latest venture in the field of embedded electronics and the most successful configuration for embedded systems, is in great demand these days. CompactRIO, a powerful control and acquisition system introduced by National Instruments, is based upon reconfigurable FPGA technology. Apart from FPGA, it also incorporates a real-time processor for reliable stand alone applications. Now instrumentation engineers can also benefit from the FPGA technology without any knowledge of hardware description languages, because the CompactRIO systems can be developed using LabVIEW development platform.
In this work, we have developed a temperature controlled chamber using the NI CompactRIO. The chamber has been fabricated using the acrylic sheets. Two 200W bulbs have been used for heating purpose and a thermocouple for temperature sensing. A small CPU fan has been used for cooling and only comes into action during emergency situation. A thermocouple input module (NI 9211) has been used to acquire data from thermocouple and a digital output module (NI 9474) has been used to drive the bulbs (via a relay card) and the fan. PID control algorithm has been used for our application and is implemented in LabVIEW.},

  abstract = {The origins of GEC Avionics (GAv) have two distinct roots, Elliott and Marconi, both of which are historically significant. Table 1 shows the early major nlilestones in the company's history. The company can trace its ongIns right back to William Elliott who set up as an instrument maker in 1800. Elliotts were equipping aircraft with instruments in 1909, but even before that pocket altimeters, similar to that shown in Figure 1, were being nlanufactured, and may well have been used by balloonists. A gentleman balloonist would only have had to attach his altimeter to his watch chain for safe keeping! Figure 2 shows an advertisenlent for Elliott Flying Instruments in Flight magazine (now Flight International» of 20 November 1909. Typical of those instruments are the airspeed indicator, altimeter and inclinometer shown in Figure 3, with which the Vickers Gunbus was equipped. The Marconi Company pioneered wireless telegraphy, the foundation of modern radio. As mentioned in Table 1, Marconi equipment was used in aircraft-ta-ground communications tests in 1909 and Figure 4 is a photograph taken during such a test. During the test programme, the transmitted signal was received intelligibly at a distance of 400 m. By 1913 the Marconi Aeronautical Division was able to offer for sale their type AD2 wireless which is illustrated in Figure 5. In modern terms the AD2 system would be described as comprising 6 line-replaceable units (LRUs) plus interconnecting cables. Note also that one of the LRUs is an airstream driven generator. It is interesting to note that, to this day, the type numbers of airborne radio products of GEC Sensors are prefixed with the letter's 'AD'. The present-day companies of GEC Avionics, based at Rochester, and GEC Sensors, based at Basildon, are the direct descendants of the old Elliott and Marconi companies respectively with a cOlnbined product range encompassing a major part of the total avionics field.},

During the past 30 years, pilot involvement in aircraft navigation, guidance and control has shifted from manual control to supervision of the navigation system. The domain of digital avionics provided the enablers for this shift, and several important developments started already over half a century ago. One aspect of these developments concerns the instruments designed to provide the pilot with the required information. When considering today's systems, it is not immediately obvious that for several of the currently implemented concepts there have been other, competing ones that for some reason did not make it. It may come as a surprise that some of these alternatives are conceptually superior but required technology that at the time was not sufficiently mature for implementation in an aircraft. In this paper, the history of some promising alternatives is provided, and it is speculated why these ended up as missed opportunities. To illustrate how certain instrument / data presentation concepts are better suited to provide the required guidance, navigation and control information for both skill and knowledge-based involvement of the pilot, a classification based on the inner-, directional-, and outer-loop closure of the navigation function is used. It is argued that due to the increased complexity of the pilot's supervisory control task in a future air-traffic environment, some of these alternatives need to be reconsidered as a basis for decision support, and it is illustrated what opportunities exist.},

  abstract  = {Fieldbus technology in industrial automation is not only rela- tively complex because of the number of solutions possible, but also, and above all, because of the variety of applications. Ironically, these in turn are responsible for the multitude of solutions avail- able. If the analysis of the basic needs is relatively standard, as they will always involve connecting sensors, actuators, and field con- trollers with each other, the options in architecture are numerous and can impose the need for certain services. The required perfor- mances themselves and the QoS expected fundamentally depend on the applications.
This paper traces this technology from its beginnings, which go back to the first industrial networks in the 1970s. The principal stages of development are recounted, from the initial requirement specifications to the current state of international standardization. The diverse technical solutions are then analyzed and classified. In particular, we study the temporal aspects, the medium access con- trol protocols, and application relationships.},
